==========
sig_type.h defines two types: IN_SIGNAL and OUT_SIGNAL. They are both just structs with the parametrs of input and output signal.
Function, that read parametrs from file accept two pointers to IN_SIGNAL and OUT_SIGNAL (I would make it return signals, but (it's not Go) function cannot return two objects and I don't want make two functions. Also pointers==performance.
